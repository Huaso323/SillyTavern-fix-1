# SillyTavern-fix
SillyTavern with Poe integration. Result of merging the Poe connection achieved by GlizzyChief to the latest SillyTavern version. This is a prototype and will be updated as bugs arise with the integration.

## How to install

Just follow the steps for the GlizzyChief version, changing only the "git clone" to the version you want.

- For the integration with latest SillyTavern

    - git clone https://github.com/LegendPoet/SillyTavern-fix.git -b main

- For the integration with SillyTavern 1.9.7(most stable)

    - git clone https://github.com/LegendPoet/SillyTavern-fix.git -b stable


Install or update to the (main) branch only if you need the latest SillyTavern improvements or want to support this new integration by providing feedback and reporting bugs. Otherwise, is recommend use or continue  the 1.9.7-fix version(stable).

From then on, you don't need any additional implementation. The original GlizzyChief project here: https://github.com/GlizzyChief/SillyTavern-1.8.4-fix

## It works the same as version 1.8.4?
More or less. Basically this is the reintegration of the Poe options, this time using the GlizzyChief API for the connection.

## Credits
